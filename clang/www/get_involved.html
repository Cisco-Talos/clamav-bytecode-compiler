<h1>Getting Involved with the Clang Project</h1>

<p>Once you have <a href="get_started.html">checked out and built</a> clang and
played around with it, you might be wondering what you can do to make it better
and contribute to its development.  Alternatively, maybe you just want to follow
the development of the project to see it progress.
</p>

<h2>Follow what's going on</h2>

<p>Clang is a subproject of the <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM Project</a>, but
has its own mailing lists because the communities have people with different
interests.  The two clang lists are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-commits">cfe-commits
</a> - This list is for patch submission/discussion.</li>

<li><a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev">cfe-dev</a> - 
This list is for everything else clang related (questions and answers, bug
reports, etc).</li>

</ul>

<p>If you are interested in clang only, these two lists should be all
you need.  If you are interested in the LLVM optimizer and code generator,
please consider signing up for <a 
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev">llvmdev</a> and <a
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvm-commits">llvm-commits</a>
as well.</p>


<p>The best way to talk with other developers on the project is through the <a
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev">cfe-dev mailing
list</a>.  The clang mailing list is a very friendly place and we welcome
newcomers.  In addition to the cfe-dev list, a significant amount of design
discussion takes place on the <a 
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-commits">cfe-commits mailing
list</a>.  All of these lists have archives, so you can browse through previous
discussions or follow the list development on the web if you prefer.</p>

<p>If you're looking for something to work on, check out our <a href="OpenProjects.html">Open Projects</a> page or go look through the <a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/">Bugzilla bug database.</p>
