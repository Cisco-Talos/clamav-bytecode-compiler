re2c is in the public domain.  The data structures and algorithms used
in re2c are all either taken from documents available to the general

be distributed freely.  re2c itself may be distributed freely, in source
or binary, unchanged or modified.  Distributors may charge whatever fees
they can obtain for re2c.

If you do make use of re2c, or incorporate it into a larger project an
acknowledgement somewhere (documentation, research report, etc.) would
be appreciated.
