// The "basic_string" extern template instantiation declaration is supposed to
// suppress the implicit instantiation of non-inline member functions. Make sure
// that we suppress the implicit instantiation of non-inline member functions
// defined out-of-line. That we aren't instantiating the basic_string
// constructor when we shouldn't be. Such an instantiation forces the implicit
// instantiation of _S_construct<const char*>. Since _S_construct is a member
// template, it's instantiation is *not* suppressed (despite being in
// basic_string<char>), so we would emit it as a weak definition.
