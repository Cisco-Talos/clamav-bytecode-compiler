; PR1280 - we should be able to reduce this function to a trunc/sext but it
;          would involve using a bit width (24) that doesn't match a size that
;          the back end can handle. This test makes sure that such a transform
;          is not done. It should be removed when code gen supports "funny"
;          bit widths.
