ClamBCTargetMachine.cpp has where a lot of the passes are added.

DataLayout
e-p:64:8:8-i1:8:8-i8:8:8-i16:16:16-i32:32:32-i64:64:64:a0:0:64
Data layout is separated by '-'s.
e = Little Endian
p:64:8:8 = 64-bit pointer, abi is 8 bit, preferred alignment is 8 bit.
i1:8:8 = 1-bit integer, abi is 8 bit, preferred alignment is 8 bit.
i8:8:8 = 8-bit integer, abi is 8 bit, preferred alignment is 8 bit.
i16:16:16 = 16-bit integer, abi is 16 bit, preferred alignment is 16 bit.
i32:32:32 = 32-bit integer, abi is 32 bit, preferred alignment is 32 bit.
i64:64:64 = 64-bit integer, abi is 64 bit, preferred alignment is 64 bit.

Don't want to specify the 32-bit triple, unless we fix the headers to properly define 64-bit types.
